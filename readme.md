# Laravel docker template

I used these files often to bootstrap several laravel projects I've been working on. So This is a central repo for me to store them so that others can easily use them too.

Simply include the files here inside a new laravel project

It uses the default `.env` values, so you'll need to update the `docker-compose.yml` for any custom database values you wish.
